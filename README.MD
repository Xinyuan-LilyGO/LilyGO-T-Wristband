# T-Wristband

## 1.Install the following dependency library files:
- [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI)
- [PCF8563_Library](https://github.com/lewisxhe/PCF8563_Library)

## 2.TFT_eSPI settings
- Install TFT_eSPI, in `TFT_eSPI/User_Setup_Select.h`, comment out the default settings `#include <User_Setup.h>` , select `#include <User_Setups/Setup26_TTGO_T_Wristband.h>` , Save Settings.

- Configure TFT_eSPI as shown below

### 3. Precautions
- **WiFiManager** is used for WiFi settings by default. Please connect to `T-Wristband` hotspot for network configuration for the first time.
- The OTA update and upgrade is enabled by default. After the WiFi configuration is complete, you can select `T-Wristband` from the port in the Arduino IDE to perform wireless upgrades to get rid of the constraints of downloading the data cable. ***Please update your own code. Please keep the ota upgrade part, otherwise the upgrade may cause failure Air upgrade again***

- Touch and hold the button for three seconds to reset the WiFi and restart. After resetting, you need to configure again.
- Note that `WiFiManager` uses the development branch. Please make sure that the [development branch](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager/tree/development) is cloned, otherwise it will not compile successfully. There is a WiFiManager library used in the libdeps directory. **If you cannot compile, please copy the files in the libdeps directory to `C:\Documents\Arduino\libraries`**

## 4.Board choose
- The board can choose `ESP32 Dev Module`, other settings can keep the default
